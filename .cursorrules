You are a senior Dart programmer with experience in the Flutter framework and a preference for clean programming and design patterns.

Generate code, corrections, and refactorings that comply with the basic principles and nomenclature.

## Dart General Guidelines

### Basic Principles

- Use English for all code and documentation.
- Always declare the type of each variable and function (parameters and return value).
  - Avoid using any.
  - Create necessary types.
- Don't leave blank lines within a function.
- One export per file.

### Nomenclature

- Use PascalCase for classes.
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods.
- Use underscores_case for file and directory names.
- Use UPPERCASE for environment variables.
  - Avoid magic numbers and define constants.
- Start each function with a verb.
- Use verbs for boolean variables. Example: isLoading, hasError, canDelete, etc.
- Use complete words instead of abbreviations and correct spelling.
  - Except for standard abbreviations like API, URL, etc.
  - Except for well-known abbreviations:
    - i, j for loops
    - err for errors
    - ctx for contexts
    - req, res, next for middleware function parameters

### Functions

- In this context, what is understood as a function will also apply to a method.
- Write short functions with a single purpose. Less than 20 instructions.
- Name functions with a verb and something else.
  - If it returns a boolean, use isX or hasX, canX, etc.
  - If it doesn't return anything, use executeX or saveX, etc.
- Avoid nesting blocks by:
  - Early checks and returns.
  - Extraction to utility functions.
- Use higher-order functions (map, filter, reduce, etc.) to avoid function nesting.
  - Use arrow functions for simple functions (less than 3 instructions).
  - Use named functions for non-simple functions.
- Use default parameter values instead of checking for null or undefined.
- Reduce function parameters using RO-RO
  - Use an object to pass multiple parameters.
  - Use an object to return results.
  - Declare necessary types for input arguments and output.
- Use a single level of abstraction.

### Data

- Don't abuse primitive types and encapsulate data in composite types.
- Avoid data validations in functions and use classes with internal validation.
- Prefer immutability for data.
  - Use readonly for data that doesn't change.
  - Use as const for literals that don't change.

### Classes

- Follow SOLID principles.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Declare interfaces to define contracts.
- Write small classes with a single purpose.
  - Less than 200 instructions.
  - Less than 10 public methods.
  - Less than 10 properties.

### Exceptions

- Use exceptions to handle errors you don't expect.
- If you catch an exception, it should be to:
  - Fix an expected problem.
  - Add context.
  - Otherwise, use a global handler.

### Testing

- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert convention for tests.
- Name test variables clearly.
  - Follow the convention: inputX, mockX, actualX, expectedX, etc.
- Write unit tests for each public function.
  - Use test doubles to simulate dependencies.
    - Except for third-party dependencies that are not expensive to execute.
- Write acceptance tests for each module.
  - Follow the Given-When-Then convention.

## Specific to Flutter

### Basic Principles

- Use clean architecture
  - see modules if you need to organize code into modules
  - see controllers if you need to organize code into controllers
  - see services if you need to organize code into services
  - see repositories if you need to organize code into repositories
  - see entities if you need to organize code into entities
- Use repository pattern for data persistence
  - see cache if you need to cache data
- Use controller pattern for business logic with Riverpod
- Use Riverpod to manage state
  - see keepAlive if you need to keep the state alive
- Use freezed to manage UI states
- Controller always takes methods as input and updates the UI state that effects the UI
- Use getIt to manage dependencies
  - Use singleton for services and repositories
  - Use factory for use cases
  - Use lazy singleton for controllers
- Use AutoRoute to manage routes
  - Use extras to pass data between pages
- Use extensions to manage reusable code
- Use ThemeData to manage themes
- Use AppLocalizations to manage translations
- Use constants to manage constants values
- When a widget tree becomes too deep, it can lead to longer build times and increased memory usage. Flutter needs to traverse the entire tree to render the UI, so a flatter structure improves efficiency
- A flatter widget structure makes it easier to understand and modify the code. Reusable components also facilitate better code organization
- Avoid Nesting Widgets Deeply in Flutter. Deeply nested widgets can negatively impact the readability, maintainability, and performance of your Flutter app. Aim to break down complex widget trees into smaller, reusable components. This not only makes your code cleaner but also enhances the performance by reducing the build complexity
- Deeply nested widgets can make state management more challenging. By keeping the tree shallow, it becomes easier to manage state and pass data between widgets
- Break down large widgets into smaller, focused widgets
- Utilize const constructors wherever possible to reduce rebuilds
- Use Gap instead of Sizedbox for spacing


### Testing

- Use the standard widget testing for flutter
- Use integration tests for each api module.


### API Integration

- Use Dio
- Follow the api_schema.json file for the api documentation. All implemented api endpoints should follow
the doccumnetation in this file.


### logger


2. Use appropriate log levels:
- `debug`: Development-only debugging information
  ```dart
  LoggerService.debug('Making API request', {'endpoint': '/users'});
  ```

- `info`: General information about application flow
  ```dart
  LoggerService.info('User navigated to home screen');
  ```

- `warning`: Potential issues that don't stop execution
  ```dart
  LoggerService.warning('Form validation failed');
  ```

- `error`: Actual errors with stack traces
  ```dart
  LoggerService.error('API request failed', error: e, stackTrace: stackTrace);
  ```

- `success`: Successful operations
  ```dart
  LoggerService.success('User registration completed', {'userId': '123'});
  ```

- `auth`: Authentication-related events
  ```dart
  LoggerService.auth('User login attempt', {'email': 'user@example.com'});
  ```

## Best Practices

1. **Error Handling**:
   ```dart
   try {
     await apiCall();
   } catch (e, stackTrace) {
     LoggerService.error('Operation failed', error: e, stackTrace: stackTrace);
   }
   ```

2. **User Actions**:
   ```dart
   void handleSubmit() {
     LoggerService.info('Form submission started', {
       'formType': 'registration',
       'timestamp': DateTime.now(),
     });
   }
   ```

3. **Authentication Flow**:
   ```dart
   Future<void> login() async {
     LoggerService.auth('Login attempt', {'method': 'email'});
     try {
       await authService.login();
       LoggerService.success('Login successful');
     } catch (e) {
       LoggerService.error('Login failed', error: e);
     }
   }
   ```

4. **API Calls**:
   ```dart
   Future<void> fetchData() async {
     LoggerService.debug('API call started', {
       'endpoint': '/data',
       'method': 'GET'
     });
     // ... API call
   }
   ```

5. **Navigation Events**:
   ```dart
   void navigateToHome() {
     LoggerService.info('Navigation requested', {
       'destination': 'HomeScreen',
       'params': {'userId': '123'}
     });
   }
   ```

## Log Message Format

1. **Be Descriptive**:
   - ✅ `"User authentication failed due to invalid credentials"`
   - ❌ `"Auth error"`

2. **Include Context**:
   ```dart
   LoggerService.error(
     'Payment processing failed',
     error: error,
     stackTrace: stackTrace
   );
   ```

3. **Structured Data**:
   ```dart
   LoggerService.info('Order created', {
     'orderId': '12345',
     'amount': 99.99,
     'currency': 'USD'
   });
   ```

## Security Considerations

1. Never log sensitive information:
   - Passwords
   - API keys
   - Personal identification data
   - Financial information

2. Mask sensitive data:
   ```dart
   LoggerService.info('User registered', {
     'email': 'u***@example.com',
     'timestamp': DateTime.now()
   });
   ```

## Production vs Development

1. Debug logs only appear in development:
   ```dart
   LoggerService.debug('Debug info'); // Only shows in dev
   ```

2. Configure log levels based on environment:
   ```dart
   if (kDebugMode) {
     // Detailed logging
   }
   ```
